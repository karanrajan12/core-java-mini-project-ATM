# Core Java Mini Project - SIMPLE CONSOLE BASED ATM MACHINE

This repository contains a **core Java mini project** developed for **learning and practice purposes**.  
It is a **console-based application** created to understand Java fundamentals, object-oriented concepts, and basic project structure.

## Features
- User authentication
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Deposit operation
- Balance inquiry
- Modular and well-structured code
- Console-based interaction

## Technologies & Concepts Used
- Core Java
- Console-based input/output
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interfaces and implementations
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- HashMap for storing user credentials
- MD5 hashing using `MessageDigest` for securing PIN data  
  > Note: MD5 is used here strictly for learning purposes.

## Purpose
This project was created **purely for learning** to gain hands-on experience with core Java concepts by building and completing a working console application.

## Demo Credentials
This project uses **sample data** for demonstration.

- Card Number: `123456789`
- PIN: `1234`

Additional user credentials can be added in the `UserCredentials` class.
